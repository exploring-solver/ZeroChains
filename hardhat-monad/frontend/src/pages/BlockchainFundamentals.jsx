            A blockchain is a <strong>distributed, immutable, and transparent digital ledger</strong>. 
            Think of it like a shared spreadsheet or accounting book that's duplicated across many 
            computers in a network.

                    highly resistant to single points of failure or censorship.

                    or Keccak256). Each new block also contains the hash of the previous block.

                    This linking of blocks using hashes creates a "chain." If someone tries to tamper

                    its link to the next block, breaking the chain and making tampering immediately obvious.

                  <Typography variant="body2">
                    Before a new block can be added to the chain, the nodes in the network must agree on 
                    its validity. This agreement process is called a consensus mechanism (e.g., Proof-of-Work 
                    where nodes solve complex puzzles, or Proof-of-Stake where nodes stake collateral).

                    Because the ledger is distributed and validated by many independent nodes following

              Blockchain architecture consists of blocks that contain transaction data, a timestamp, 
              and a reference to the previous block (hash). This creates an append-only chain of blocks 
              that is extremely difficult to modify retroactively.
